# üëã Hi folks !

### üë§ A bit about myself
I'm Malo, a french developer since my 10's.
I like to automate things because I'm lazy.
I like toreverse engineer both applications and APIs because I don't like being restrained.
I'm currently a student at Epitech at Lille (promo 2027).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Some projects I made

Remember when I said I don't like to be restrained ? Well, I don't like to have to create an account on a website to use it. I want to feel free and fetch data about people without having to log me in and give my data to those companies.

- [My own Instagram API (no account needed)](https://github.com/Ximaz/instagram-api) : Scrap biographies, posts, number of follows / following people, and so on without an Instagram account.

- [My own Instagram content downloader](https://github.com/Ximaz/instagram-downloader) : Download highlights preview, Instagram pictures and videos without an Instagram account.

- [An Intel x8086 NASM DosBox Clock Reader](https://github.com/Ximaz/intel_x8086_clock) : I didn't know `Intel x8086` until someone who saw I knew `Intel x86` asked me if I could help them to read clock from a DosBox in assembly `Intel x8086`, which obviously I help.

- [An image loader which counters Microsoft Edge `Search Image` button](https://github.com/Ximaz/edge-no-search-image) : For confidentiality purposes, especially in companies, you don't want your images to go all over the Internet. Yet, some Microsoft Edge users might misclick on this little `Search Image` button, which makes a reverse image search by taking their confidential image and trying to find it's source all over the Internet. This projects loads the image inside a canvas which Microsoft Edge won't interpret as an image, and then the `Search Image` button won't be diplayed.

- [A Grafana x Prometheus x Node Exporter installer so you don't have to do anything](https://github.com/Ximaz/grafatheus) : This allows you to easily deploy a monitoring solution so that you have nothing to do more than configuring once installed.
